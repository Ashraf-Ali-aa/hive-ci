*Run your tests on real devices without the pain*

Hive CI is a CI system built around devices:
* execute your tests on physical devices
* connect all your devices & put them to work for you
* compare results across different models & configurations
* monitor devices for stability and performance

Hive CI is language/framework agnostic & used by different teams in the BBC with different requirements:
* Calabash UI tests on mobiles
* Appium browser and native app tests
* Javascript TV application automation
* Live on-device performance monitoring

Hive CI understands your tests:
* Distinguish between failures & infrastructure problems
* Parallelise your tests runs
* Quickly retry only your failures
* Identify flakey tests
