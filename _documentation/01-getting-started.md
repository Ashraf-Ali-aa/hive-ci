Hive CI -- Key concepts

## Introducing Hive CI

## Hive components

### Scheduler

### Runner

The Runner is the component that executes the tests and submits results. It is
also responsible for monitoring and looking after devices. The core of the
runner is the hive-runner gem and this needs to be supplemented by another gem,
such as hive-runner-android, to provide device specific functionality. The base
hive-runner gem provides a shell runner that enables scripts to be run on the
server.

### DeviceDB

### Testmine
